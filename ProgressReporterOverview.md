This plugin is not recommend for use at lower tiers as it might be hazardous to your morale.

The author himself did not make it until they had reached T6.  The halfway point for
experience before the July 2012 reboot was T6R3L175.  After
the July 2014 reboot it is T6R6L1.  You have been warned.

Aardwolf Experience Reporter v1.1.0 Help

progress <channel>               -  Will send to the <channel> a players total
experience, total levels, and SHs remaining
until T9 SH.

progress hypo <channel> TxRxLx   -  Will send to the <channel> a hypothetical players
total experience, total levels, and SHs remaining
until T9 SH.

progress other <name> <channel>  -  Will finger player with <name> and capture that
players progress compared to a T9 SH and send that
information to the <channel>.

progress toggle expsetting       -  A change in July 2014 decreased the exp across all
tiers.  When this is ON, the plugin will calculate
your exp using the lower exp.  For now this setting
defaults to OFF, and won't save across sessions.
*See note below....

progress help                    -  Displays this help file.

*Since the plugin doesn't know how much of your previous exp was under the old or new
system, it just assumes you got all of your previous exp under the same system.  This
is controlled by whichever system is toggled.```

# Download and installation. #
  1. Download the file from here - http://a-few-random-aard-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Aardwolf_Experience_Reporter.xml.
  1. Save the file to your Muschlient Install folder.  I recommend creating a sub-folder inside the plugins folder called something like "My Plugins." This makes it easier to move to a new install of Mushclient, by just moving that folder.
  1. Go to MUSHclient's File menu, select 'Plugins' (Shift+Ctrl+P), and then click on the 'Add' button. Choose the appropriate plugin file from the file browser.
