# Download and installation. #
  1. Download the file from here - http://a-few-random-aard-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Aardwolf_Auto_Clan_Donater.xml.
  1. Save the file to your Muschlient Install folder.  I recommend creating a sub-folder inside the plugins folder called something like "My Plugins." This makes it easier to move to a new install of Mushclient, by just moving that folder.
  1. Go to MUSHclient's File menu, select 'Plugins' (Shift+Ctrl+P), and then click on the 'Add' button. Choose the appropriate plugin file from the file browser.
