= Introduction =
This plugin is a very simple repop reporter, which sends a short message to a channel when the plugin receives a GMCP repop event.  Unlike triggers based on repop messages, this will work in any area and for as long as GMCP works as it does currently.

= Download and installation. =
  # Download the file from here - [http://a-few-random-aard-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Aardwolf_Repop_Reporter.xml].
  # Save the file to your Muschlient Install folder.  I recommend creating a sub-folder inside the plugins folder called something like "My Plugins." This makes it easier to move to a new install of Mushclient, by just moving that folder.
  # Go to MUSHclient's File menu, select 'Plugins' (Shift+Ctrl+P), and then click on the 'Add' button. Choose the appropriate plugin file from the file browser.
