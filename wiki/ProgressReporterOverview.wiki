progress toggle expsetting       -  A change in July 2012 decreased the exp for T0/T1
                                    players.  When this is ON, the plugin will calculate
                                    your exp using the lower exp for T0/T1.  For now
                                    this setting defaults to off, and won't save across
                                    sessions.

= Download and installation. =
  # Download the file from here - [http://a-few-random-aard-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Aardwolf_Experience_Reporter.xml].
  # Save the file to your Muschlient Install folder.  I recommend creating a sub-folder inside the plugins folder called something like "My Plugins." This makes it easier to move to a new install of Mushclient, by just moving that folder.
  # Go to MUSHclient's File menu, select 'Plugins' (Shift+Ctrl+P), and then click on the 'Add' button. Choose the appropriate plugin file from the file browser.
