Aardwolf Instinct/Mastery Reporter v 1.0
<================================ ACTIONS =================================>
help report                --> Displays this help file and the mudside help
>  file for the report command.
report instinct <chan>     --> Reports instinct. If <chan> is omitted
> reports to the room. WARNING: will not work
> if you have a pagesize set below 51.
report mastery  <chan>     --> Reports mastery. If <chan> is omitted reports
>  to the room.

Note: You'll need a fairly large pagesize for this to work properly.
If you have a smaller page size the plugin should warn you, but it
won't report anything.

# Download and installation. #
  1. Download the file from here - http://a-few-random-aard-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Aardwolf_Instinct_Mastery_Reporter.xml.
  1. Save the file to your Muschlient Install folder.  I recommend creating a sub-folder inside the plugins folder called something like "My Plugins." This makes it easier to move to a new install of Mushclient, by just moving that folder.
  1. Go to MUSHclient's File menu, select 'Plugins' (Shift+Ctrl+P), and then click on the 'Add' button. Choose the appropriate plugin file from the file browser.
